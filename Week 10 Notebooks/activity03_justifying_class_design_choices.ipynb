        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "By the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n",
        "- Understand and apply basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
        "- Justify the design choices made when creating class structures in Python.\n",
        "- Evaluate and improve your design approach using AI tools responsibly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a crucial paradigm in software development, known for its ability to encapsulate data and functions into structures known as classes. This approach not only enhances code modularity and reusability but also simplifies complex software designs. As budding software developers, understanding how to design and justify your class structures will be essential in your programming career.\n",

        "## Using AI Tools Ethically & Effectively\n",
        "> **Transparency:** Always disclose when and how you have used AI assistance in your work. It's important to be open about the tools you use and how they contribute to your outcomes.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **Critical Evaluation:** Remember, AI is a tool—not a replacement for your judgement. Always review and critically assess the AI-generated content before including it in your work.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **Learning Partner:** Use AI to deepen your understanding. Ask it to explain concepts or provide examples, but ensure you're still engaging deeply with the material and not just copying answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure).\n",
        "- **Inheritance:** A mechanism for creating a new class using details of an existing class without modifying it.\n",
        "- **Polymorphism:** The ability to redefine methods for derived classes.\n",
        "- **Encapsulation:** Keeping the data inside a class safe from external modification.\n",
