    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyse the strengths and limitations of using a dictionary-powered approach for an inventory management system.\n",
    "- Evaluate the suitability of different inventory management strategies for a given business scenario.\n",
    "- Justify the design choices you make when implementing a dictionary-powered inventory system.\n",
    "- Compare and contrast various data structures and techniques for efficient inventory tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective inventory management is crucial for businesses to maintain optimal stock levels, minimise waste, and ensure product availability. In this activity, you will explore how to design a dictionary-powered inventory management system and learn to justify the decisions you make throughout the process. By developing this skill, you'll be better equipped to tackle complex, real-world inventory challenges that require critical thinking and problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using AI Tools Ethically & Effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through this activity, you may find it helpful to use AI tools, such as language models, to assist with tasks like brainstorming, explaining concepts, or generating code. However, it's important to use these tools responsibly and critically.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI, always be transparent about your use of the tool, and carefully evaluate the output to ensure it is accurate and aligned with the specific requirements of the task. Treat the AI as a learning partner, not a black box solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could ask an AI system: \"What are the potential limitations of using a dictionary-based approach for an inventory management system, and how might those limitations be addressed?\" Then, critically examine the AI's response and consider how it applies to your specific scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary Data Structure**: A key-value store that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of inventory data.\n",
    "- **Inventory Tracking**: The process of monitoring and managing the stock levels of goods or materials.\n",
    "- **Inventory Management Strategies**: Approaches to optimising inventory levels, such as just-in-time (JIT) or economic order quantity (EOQ).\n",
    "- **Inventory Reporting**: Generating reports to track inventory levels, usage, and trends.\n",
    "- **Data Structures for Inventory**: Comparing the suitability of different data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets) for inventory management tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Activities (Focus on Higher-Order Thinking)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity 1: Conceptual Application & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked with designing an inventory management system for a small retail business that sells a variety of products. The business owner wants to use a dictionary-powered approach to track inventory levels and generate reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the process you would use to design this inventory management system. In your explanation, address the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the key considerations you would take into account when choosing a dictionary-based approach?\n",
    "- What potential challenges or limitations might you encounter when using a dictionary for inventory management, and how would you address them?\n",
    "- How would you structure the dictionary to efficiently store and retrieve inventory data?"

    "### Activity 2: Evaluation, Comparison, and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "The business owner has asked you to compare two different inventory management strategies: just-in-time (JIT) and economic order quantity (EOQ). They want you to evaluate the suitability of each approach for their business and justify your recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a detailed comparison of the JIT and EOQ strategies, addressing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the key principles and assumptions behind the JIT and EOQ approaches.\n",
    "- Identify the potential advantages and disadvantages of each strategy for the given business scenario.\n",
    "- Justify which inventory management strategy you would recommend for this business and explain your reasoning.\n",
