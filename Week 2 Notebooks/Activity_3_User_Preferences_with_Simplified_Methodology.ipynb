        "## Learning Outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "Apply a structured problem-solving methodology to design and implement a User Preferences programme. In this activity, you will practice computational thinking by breaking down the problem into manageable steps—from planning and pseudocode to coding your final solution—and learn how to use AI tools to support your process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 1 – State the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Goal:**  \n",
        "  Build a programme that collects several user preferences and then displays these preferences in a clear, personalised summary.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Considerations:**  \n",
        "  - What information should the programme gather?  \n",
        "    *(For example: name, favourite colour, favourite food, hobby, etc.)*\n",
        "  - How should the programme present this information?  \n",
        "    *(For example: a greeting message that summarizes all responses.)*\n",
        "\n",
        "*Reflect:* Write down in your own words what you want the programme to achieve.\n",
        "\n",
        "**AI Tip:**  \n",
        "Use an AI tool (like ChatGPT) to help you rephrase your description. For instance, ask:  \n",
        "> \"Can you restate my description of a user preferences programme to ensure I have captured the intent correctly?\"  \n",
        "Then, review the response to confirm that it aligns with what you have learned so far—using only input(), print(), basic primitive datatypes, and variables.\n",

        "  - Favourite Colour\n",
        "  - Favourite Food\n",
        "  - Favourite Hobby\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Output:**  \n",
        "  Decide on the format of your summary message. For instance:\n",

        "\n",
        "*Tip:* Mapping your inputs to the expected output helps you see the overall flow of your programme.\n",
        "\n",
        "**AI Tip:**  \n",
        "Ask an AI tool for suggestions by saying, \"What are some creative ways to format a user preferences summary?\" Ensure the answer only uses concepts you’ve learned so far.\n",

        "  Imagine a user named \"Alice\" who selects:\n",
        "  - Favourite Colour: Blue\n",
        "  - Favourite Food: Pasta\n",
        "  - Favourite Hobby: Reading\n",
        "\n",

        "  > \"Hello, Alice! Your favourite colour is Blue, you love Pasta, and you enjoy Reading.\"\n",
        "\n",
